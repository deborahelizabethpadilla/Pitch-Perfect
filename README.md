# Pitch Perfect

**Summary:**

This application was created specifically for [Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com). This project firmed up my knowledge on creating an application that implements AVFoundation, allowing user to record messages in different effects.

**The application offers the following features:**

* Creating an application allowing users to record in different voice effects.

**Technologies Used In Application:**
* AVFoundation
* Stack Views
* Auto Layout
* UIKit
* Swift

**Testing The App:**
* Download the project to your computer from this project page.
* Once the project is downloaded, open the .xcodeproj file from the folder.
* Run the project either using the iPhone simulator or your device. I recommend running the project on the latest iPhone device. It should be compiled with the latest version of Xcode.
* If you choose to download it on your device, please plug in your device to your computer and make the device target your device model. Then click 'run'.

**Closing:**

In conclusion, I have learned a lot by working on this project. I am confident that I mastered AVFoundation and am able to successfully create applications using different scenes, functions and assets in order to create an exciting application.
